## Usage
When you cloned the repository from GitHub or installed the SAR archive you can simply open up a Workspace and type
```smalltalk
MEXTool open
```
and press Ctrl+D (or Cmd+D on Mac) to run the code and open the Morphplorer.

## Features
- OverView: The window that appears when you open the tool. It gives you an overview in which categories you could search for methods related to the Morphic framework
- ExplorationView: The window that appears after clicking on a category in OverView. Here you can select multiple methods from the tree (top left), see the morph before those methods were applied on it (bottom, left), the morph after those methods were applied on it (top right) and a codeholder to see how you can apply these changes with Smalltalk code and play around by changing the code and running it via the "Run code"-button or Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S).
