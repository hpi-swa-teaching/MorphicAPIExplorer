I'm your typical linter class that is used to test the package 'MorphicAPIExplorer-Core' with the linting rules provided by SwaLint and as far as possible in accordance with the coding standards. Detailed results will be outputted in the console. Tests that lead to errors or false positives are prefixed with 'broken' or 'dont'. The latter are still performed collectively as an extra test, but this test will never fail and is only for outputting the results.
