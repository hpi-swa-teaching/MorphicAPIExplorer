I'm a data class containing a list of MEXMethods representing methods of the Morphic framework with a specific functionality (e.g. styling, positioning). I will be displayed in the MEXOverView so I also have information like an image to get displayed nicely.

The most important method I provide is the constructor to set all the information I contain.
