I'm an ImageMorph which doesn't lose its image's quality once it's scaled. You can compare me to a SVG image if you want.

To ensure my functionality, I must remember the original Form of the image given to me. keepRatio tells me whether or not that original image's ratio should be kept. desiredExtent then tells me what the goal extent of the image is and I will scale it to that extent.
