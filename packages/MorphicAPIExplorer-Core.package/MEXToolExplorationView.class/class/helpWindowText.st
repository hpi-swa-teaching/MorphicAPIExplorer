	^ 'This is a tutorial window. Here you can try out a couple of methods covering a certain aspect of the Morphic API. If you want to go back to the overview window, just press the <Back> button. 
You can click on a method to have the resulting morphs displayed in the playground. Some methods depend on other methods or may not make sense if used with certain other methods. If you hover over a certain method, methods that work in conjunction with this method will be highlighted in green, while methods that do not properly work with the chosen method are highlighted in red.

If you click the <Save Morph> button, the morphs currently displayed in the playground will be saved in the bottom left of the window. These saved morphs will carry over to the other tutorials, so you can use the Morphplorer to build a morph according to your needs.

If you cllick the <run> button the code displayed in the codeholder below will be executed. You can also press the <copy> button to copy the code directly to your clipboard. The <source> button can be used to change th display of the code in the codeholder.'
