I'm an extended ToolBuilder responsible for building all of Morphplorer's additional Pluggables like the MEXPluggableMultiSelectionTreeSpec. I must know about the additional MEX-classes and provide methods to build them.

You can build a spec with methods like "buildXY", e.g.: #buildPluggableMultiSelectionTree.
