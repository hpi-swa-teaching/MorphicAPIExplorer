As a MEXListItemWrapper I represent an item which will be displayed in the MEXPluggableMultiSelectionTreeMorph in the MEXExplorationView. So I only have information about my layout like my label and my icon as well as the parent I have in the tree.

The most important method I provide is the constructor to set my model, my tree parent as well as the item I get my information for layout from.
