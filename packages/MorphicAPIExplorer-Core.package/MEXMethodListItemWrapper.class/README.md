As a MEXMethodListItemWrapper I represent an item which will be displayed in the multiselection tree in MEXExplorationView. So I only have information about my layout like my label and my icon as well as the parent I have in the tree.

The most important method I provide is the constructor to set the item I get my information for layout from as well as my model and my tree parent.
